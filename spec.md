## My personal website will have:

- Home page for self congratulatory back patting
- Blog page which is actually the home page for writings and musings
- A collection of things I’ve read and why I found them useful (maybe a small database here would be fun to build)
- A list of things I want to read and where I can find them
- A way for people to comment on this list and help me evaluate them
- Perhaps I’ll build a substack feed into the homepage to serve as the “blogosphere” and to help me with RSS stuff

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Next, Express, Astro, Gatsby
- Host: Digital Ocean, AWS droplet
- CSS: Tailwind

## Home Page Layout

front and center: substack feed/gallery showing off my writings

red dot cursor and sidebar highlight
dynamic scrollbar
red neon mists
mixd
arrow keys to navigate

theme: sort of minimal (but not minimalist, just uncluttered) - black on white main theme with strong accents and text underlines in accent color

background very light grey
accent color yellow

Hi, I'm Alex Xu :)
Welcome to my digital garden! Here I'll be collecting little pieces of things I'll write and build over the next few years.
